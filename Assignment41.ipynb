Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n\nOrdinal Encoding assigns integer values based on the inherent order of the categories (e.g., low = 1, medium = 2, high = 3). Label Encoding assigns \nintegers without considering any order (e.g., red = 0, green = 1, blue = 2).\n\nUse Ordinal Encoding when there is a clear ranking (e.g., \"low\", \"medium\", \"high\"), and Label Encoding for unordered categories (e.g., color names).\n                                                                                                      \n# Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n \nTarget Guided Ordinal Encoding assigns integer values to categories based on their relationship with the target variable. The categories are sorted by the mean\ntarget value and then encoded with integers (higher means stronger relationship).\n\nExample: In predicting housing prices, the \"neighborhood\" feature could be encoded based on average house prices in each neighborhood.\n\n# Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n\nCovariance measures how two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the relationship: positive covariance means both variables \nincrease together, while negative covariance means one increases while the other decreases.\n\n                   n            \nCov(X,Y) = 1/(n-1) ∑ (Xi - X) (Yi- Y)\n                  i=1\n                  \nwhere Xi and Yi are values, and X and Y are the means.",

Which encoding method would you use for each variable, and why?\n\nGender: Binary encoding (Male = 0, Female = 1) because it has only two categories.\nEducation Level: One-hot encoding since it has multiple categories with no intrinsic order.\nEmployment Status: One-hot encoding for the same reason as Education Level (multiple categories, no order).\n\n# Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\", and two\n# categorical variables, \"Weather Condition\" (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy) and \"Wind Direction\" (North/South/\n# East/West).
